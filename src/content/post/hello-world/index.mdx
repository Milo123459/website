## Using some markdown elements

Here we have a simple js code block.

```js
let string = "JavaScript syntax highlighting";
```

This is styled by Shiki, set via the [config](https://docs.astro.build/en/guides/markdown-content/#syntax-highlighting) for Astro.

You can choose your own theme from this [library](https://github.com/shikijs/shiki/blob/main/docs/themes.md#all-themes), which is currently set to Dracula, in the file `astro.config.mjs`.

Here is a horizontal rule.

Here is a list:

- Item number 1
